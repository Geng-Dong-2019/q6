The Idea of this file is to provide debugging hints.
[with the long time goal to have a checklist with energy-offset and common solutions]

Created on Nov 2014, 21. by Beat Amrein

Work carefully trough this checklist to make ruse that not you, but your system is the problem.

Energy wrong by >50KCAL
Are you mapping to the right water run?
Your profile is ever increasing and has **no TS** [dG* > 50kcal]:
(you are not running the same reaction in water and protein).
Debugging:
0) Are you mapping to the right water run?
1) Check Movie (compare with your chemical intuition).
2) Check Fep Files. 
3) Compare FEP/Movie from Water- with Protein-run
4) Locate your problem, which is very likely in your FEP files. 
   [Morse, Dihedral, SoftRepulsion, Q- vs PDB numbering, etc.]
Fix:
Repair/Adjust your FEP File.

Energy wrong by >5KCAL
Your **standard deviation is large** [ >5 kcal ]:
(your replica are not the same, may be a flipping water)
1) Compare the movies of the trajectories with the highest deviation.
  You likely observe a flipping HOH, GLU, HIS etc..
  Fix:
  Use a distance or angle restraint to keep the bad guy under control.
  Or use a sequnce restraint and enable apply it also on the hydrogen of the water...
2) You did not equilibrate your system long enough and/or your 
  frames are too short.
  Fix:
  Try to run longer.
3) If you do work on a proton tranfer, you might want to apply a sequence restraint
  on your transferred protons.
  Fix:
  Use a sequence restraint.
  
Water-Run specific Problems:
Check the movies:
Q1) Your waterruns are very inconsistent and you have too many degrees of freedom:
  A1) Apply a sequence restraint of 1.0 on your reaction.
Q2) A solvent water molecule interferes with your reaction:
  A2) Apply a higher seq res, or use additional disance restaints, or run in gasphase.

Protein-Run specific Problems:
Check the movies:
Q1) You can not obtain the literature energies in protein, but your waterrun is cool:
  A: Check the ionisation of close by residues.
  A: Check hydrogen bonds and group contributions.
  A: Look at temperature, distances etc.
  A: This is a very common problem and requires you to play around. 
  
Shake Failure:
The previous run has hot atoms. If you are equilibrating the system:
try to run the previous step longer (eg double the time).

NaN:
Your system exploded. 
- Look at the movie (and/or the logfile) to see what happendend: 
  If you cant see a thing (immediate explosion), 
  decrease the stepsize (eg. to 0.01) and the trajectory interval (eg to 1). 
- Also the pdbfile you used to generate the topology with vmd and try to locate 
   strange bonds that formed, when you eg docked some substrate.
- If this does not help and you use a fep file, you have an error in your fep file.
