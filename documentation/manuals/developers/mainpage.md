Q Developers Manual {#mainpage}
===================

Introduction {#introduction}
============

This is  the developers manual for **Q**, the free  energy from molecular
dynamics program.  

**Q**  is entirely written in  modern **FORTRAN**. Its  initial development
was in  **FORTRAN**  90, but the incorporation of object oriented paradigms
into modern **FORTRAN** have  seen the code  evolve to take advantage of the
evolution of the language. Currently  the program incorporates elements of the
**FORTRAN** 2008 standard and it's developing the use of the OpenMP 4.0 standard
(*which  is  now  fully implemented   into    gnu   Fortran    version   5.1*)   for in-node parallelization.
